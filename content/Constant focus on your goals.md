## Your goals

When you read this quote meaningfully, it will struck with an epiphany. 

 > 
 > "Will this help me reach my goal?" 

Chris Hatfield, the first Canadian astronaut, also one of who spent the most time in space, dreamed to become an astronaut when he first saw man walk on the moon when he was nine years old. He made that dream come true even though Canada had no space program at the time. 

 > 
 > Later, walking back to our cottage, I looked up at the Moon. It was no longer a distant, unknowable orb but a place where people walked, talked, worked and even slept. At that moment, I knew what I wanted to do with my life. I was going to follow in the footsteps so boldly imprinted just moments before. Roaring around in a rocket, exploring space, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and human capability—I knew, with absolute clarity, that I wanted to be an astronaut.

In his book,  [An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth](https://www.amazon.com/Astronauts-Guide-Life-Earth-Determination/dp/0316253030/) he says he channeled all to become an astronaut. He spent all his life questioning every decision whether or not this would help him to become an astronaut. 

 > 
 > But from that night forward, my dream provided direction to my life. I recognized even as a 9-year-old that I had a lot of choices and my decisions mattered. What I did each day would determine the kind of person I’d become.

 > 
 > Would an astronaut eat his vegetables or have potato chips instead? Sleep in late or get up early to read a book?

## Don't lose sight

Don't lose sight on what you want to achieve. Every action is a tiny step toward or away from what you want. It also works on kids too. When they start bickering, I remind them if this is truly what they want and if these actions will bring them joy. 

Give yourself the pleasure and satisfaction of knowing you're getting one step closer to becoming the person you dream of. 

What is your dream goal?
