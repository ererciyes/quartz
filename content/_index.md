Hello ðŸ‘‹ This is Ercan /erd-john/. 

I'm a passionate product guy who loves to create and experiment with new ideas. I'm driven by the power of technology to improve lives and make us better versions of ourselves. I strive to make the most of every moment and live life to the fullest. 

I live in the land of opportunities to chase my dreams and find true joy. I co-founded startups and made exits. In each of them, I learned valuable lessons and wore many different hats. This site is a simple place to share these learnings and resources through my journey. Hope it can help you get inspired and motivated to reach your goals!

Start here to learn more about me, my work and deeper explanation about my "second brain" approach.
