Hello ðŸ‘‹ This is Ercan /erd-john/ 

I'm a passionate product guy who loves to create products and experiment with new ideas. I strive to make the most of every moment and live life to the fullest. 

I live in the land of opportunities to chase my dreams and find true joy. I co-founded startups and in each of them, I learned valuable lessons and wore many different hats. This site is a simple place to share these learnings and resources through my journey. Hope it can help you get inspired!
