## Making your own Quartz

Setting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!

### Forking

 > 
 > A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Navigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:

📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)

Then, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

### Cloning

After you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

````shell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz
````

## Editing

Great! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden. If you're ready to start writing content already, check out the recommended flow for editing notes in Quartz.
