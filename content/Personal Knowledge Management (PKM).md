As we read and access information in an increasingly digital world, a personal knowledge management (PKM) system is becoming increasingly important. Having a proper PKM system in place allows us to store, organize, and retrieve information when we need it. 

I started digging into this subject after finding myself wasting hours trying to find something in my notes. I thought an app would solve my problems, but I was wrong. Having a PKM system in place seems to be more important than which app to use. 

A PKM should become part of a routine and needs to be used whenever working with information and knowledge during:

* Evaluating / accessing,
* Creating,
* Organizing,
* Indexing,
* and most importantly, Retrieving from personal memory.

This is similar to how a computer works, where a set of commands, or an operating system, is needed to manage the data stored on its hard drive (our minds). Without this, we would be unable to locate and use information/knowledge.
