You shouldn't focus on the outcome when you're trying your best. The preparation is what matters. In other words, it's about the context in which you find yourself before taking action. If you put yourself in the right position, the result will take care of itself.

Taking the time to plan and prepare is key to achieving success. Having a strategy and taking the time to think through the steps of achieving a goal will ultimately lead to a better result. It is important to remember that effort and preparation are just as important as talent.

For instance, a novice chess player who takes the time to study and practice will often beat an experienced player who has not taken the time to prepare for the match.
