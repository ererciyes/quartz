He made that dream come true even though Canada had no space program at the time. \n\n \u003e \n \u003e Later, walking back to our cottage, I looked up at the Moon. It was no longer a distant, unknowable orb but a place where people walked, talked, worked and even slept. At that moment, I knew what I wanted to do with my life. I was going to follow in the footsteps so boldly imprinted just moments before. Roaring around in a rocket, exploring space, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and human capabilityâ€”I knew, with absolute clarity, that I wanted to be an astronaut.\n\nIn his book,  [An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth](https://www.amazon.com/Astronauts-Guide-Life-Earth-Determination/dp/0316253030/) he says he channeled all to become an astronaut. He spent all his life questioning every decision whether or not this would help him to become an astronaut. \n\n \u003e \n \u003e But from that night forward, my dream provided direction to my life. I recognized even as a 9-year-old that I had a lot of choices and my decisions mattered. What I did each day would determine the kind of person Iâ€™d become.\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Would an astronaut eat his vegetables or have potato chips instead? Sleep in late or get up early to read a book?\n\n## Don't lose sight\n\nDon't lose sight on what you want to achieve. Every action is a tiny step toward or away from what you want. It also works on kids too. When they start bickering, I remind them if this is truly what they want and if these actions will bring them joy. \n\nGive yourself the pleasure and satisfaction of knowing you're getting one step closer to becoming the person you dream of. \n\nWhat is your dream goal? \n\n\u003ciframe\n    width=\"560\"\n    height=\"315\"\n    src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaOC9danxNo\"\n    title=\"YouTube video player\" \n    frameborder=\"0\" \n    allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" \n    allowfullscreen\n\u003e\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-09T00:00:34.299862316Z","tags":null},"/Doing-your-best":{"title":"Doing your best","content":"\nYou shouldn't focus on the outcome when you're trying your best. The preparation is what matters. In other words, it's about the context in which you find yourself before taking action. If you put yourself in the right position, the result will take care of itself.\n\nTaking the time to plan and prepare is key to achieving success. Having a strategy and taking the time to think through the steps of achieving a goal will ultimately lead to a better result. It is important to remember that effort and preparation are just as important as talent.\n\nFor instance, a novice chess player who takes the time to study and practice will often beat an experienced player who has not taken the time to prepare for the match.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-09T00:00:34.299862316Z","tags":null},"/On-defining-objectives":{"title":"On defining objectives","content":"\nThe process is the set of actions taken in order to achieve a desired outcome.

I thought an app would solve my problems, but I was wrong. Having a PKM system in place seems to be moreÂ importantÂ than which app to use.Â \n\nA PKM should become part of a routine and needs to be used whenever working with information and knowledge during:\n\n* Evaluating / accessing,\n* Creating,\n* Organizing,\n* Indexing,\n* and most importantly, Retrieving from personal memory.\n\nThis is similar to how a computer works, where a set of commands, or an operating system, is needed to manage the data stored on its hard drive (our minds). Without this, we would be unable to locate and use information/knowledge.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-09T00:00:34.299862316Z","tags":null}}
